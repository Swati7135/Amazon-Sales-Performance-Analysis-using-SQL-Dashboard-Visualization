## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – core analysis
- **Excel / CSV** – data storage
- **HTML** – dashboard creation
- **Plotly.js** – interactive data visualization

## Key Insights
- Revenue is distributed across multiple product categories with Electronics and lifestyle products leading overall sales
- Delivered orders form the majority of total transactions
- Repeat customers contribute a significantly higher share of revenue compared to new customers
- Digital payment methods such as Credit Card and UPI dominate overall transactions
- Discounted orders contribute strongly to total revenue, indicating price sensitivity

## Dashboard
## Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was developed to communicate analytical insights derived from SQL queries. The dashboard focuses on presenting key business metrics and trends in a clear and intuitive manner.
Plotly.js was used for data visualization, with lightweight HTML and JavaScript utilized only to structure the dashboard and enable data loading.

- Key KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value)
- Revenue trends over time
- Category-wise and product-wise sales performance
- Payment method and order status distribution

The dashboard dynamically loads data from a JSON file generated from the dataset.


## Use Case
This project simulates a real-world sales performance analysis scenario where SQL is used to answer business questions related to revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency. It demonstrates how data analysts support business stakeholders by transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights through structured queries and dashboards.
