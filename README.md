# Amazon Sales Performance Analysis using SQL & Dashboard Visualization

This project demonstrates an end-to-end sales analytics workflow using SQL-based business analysis and interactive dashboard visualization on Amazon-style e-commerce sales data.

The focus of this project is on analytical thinking, business problem-solving, and structured data analysis rather than just dashboard creation.


## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze sales performance and customer behavior by:
- Defining business-driven analytical questions
- Solving them using SQL queries
- Interpreting results for business insights
- Presenting final insights through a dashboard


## 🧠 Analytical Workflow Followed

1. Data understanding and column classification  
2. Validation of data types and key metrics  
3. Framing business questions  
4. Writing SQL queries to answer each question  
5. Interpreting query outputs  
6. Visualizing insights using a dashboard  

## 📊 Business Questions Answered

- What is the month-wise total revenue trend?
- How many total orders were placed and what is the average order value (AOV)?
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- What are the top-selling products by revenue?
- Which cities contribute the most to total sales?
- What is the distribution of order statuses?
- Which brands generate the highest revenue?
- How do discounts impact sales revenue?
- What percentage of revenue comes from repeat customers?
- Which payment methods contribute most to revenue?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – core analysis
- **Excel / CSV** – data storage
- **HTML** – dashboard creation
- **Plotly.js** – interactive data visualization

## Key Insights
- Revenue is distributed across multiple product categories with Electronics and lifestyle products leading overall sales
- Delivered orders form the majority of total transactions
- Repeat customers contribute a significantly higher share of revenue compared to new customers
- Digital payment methods such as Credit Card and UPI dominate overall transactions
- Discounted orders contribute strongly to total revenue, indicating price sensitivity

## Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was created using HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js to visualize:

- Key KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value)
- Revenue trends over time
- Category-wise and product-wise sales performance
- Payment method and order status distribution

The dashboard dynamically loads data from a JSON file generated from the dataset.


## Use Case
This project can be used as a portfolio case study for Data Analyst roles and demonstrates practical skills in SQL-based analysis, business insight generation, and data visualization.
